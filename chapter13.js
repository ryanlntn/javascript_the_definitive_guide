// One of the most important properties of the Window object is document:
// it refers to a Document object that represents the content displayed in the window.

// One of the most important event handlers is the onload handler of the Window object.
// It is triggered when the content of the document displayed in the window is stable and ready to be manipulated.

// The use of HTML event handler attributes is considered poor style by many web
// developers who prefer to keep content and behavior separate.

// There is no formal definition of a program in client-side JavaScript.
