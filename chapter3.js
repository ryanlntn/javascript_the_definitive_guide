// Chapter 3
// Types, Values, and Variables

// Computer programs work by manipulating values (e.g. 3.14, "Hello World")

// Those values can be stored in variables (e.g. var x = 5)

// Those values which can be represented and manipulated in programming
// languages are known as types.
// JavaScript types can be divided into primitives and objects.
// Primitives include numbers, strings, and booleans as well as null and undefined.
// Objects include everything else including arrays and functions.
// JavaScript also includes the Date, Regex, and Error classes.

// JavaScript is an Object-Oriented language
  // a.sort(); // The object-oriented version of sort(a).
// In JavaScript, null and undefined are the only values that methods cannot be invoked on.
